This filter is actually quite smooth not sure if older versions sound a little smoother.

Version 4 Some changes to visual display I noticed that the 48db slope on higpass and lowpass ran really push this filter hard to create some extreme filters.  This version has red/green LEDs in reverse in future versions I am switching to dark and bright red for on and off.

Plans to make version with black rather than grey knobs. 

Plan to make parametric eq energy / db levels waterfall. 

Visualizer on/off 
type slope and character as "button selectors"
